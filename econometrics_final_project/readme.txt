This is my final project for my econometrics class. The analysis involves examining how movements in producer costs of nonrenewable energy resource extraction and refining affects end-use consumer costs. The regressions use principal component analysis to form a regression to combat the intrinsic multicollinearity of the variables and examine the extent to which each resource affects end-use consumer costs. All data is included, and descriptions are included in 'notes.txt'.
