### This is my final project for my MEGN688 (Advanced Integer Optimization) course at the Colorado School of Mines. The project uses the classic unit commitment model to solve 1-7 days worth of unit commitment cases, as well as implement efficient formulation techniques to attempt to improve efficiency of the model. This model is based off the Power Systems Optimization course developed by Professors Michael Davidson and Jesse Jenkins, and it uses data provided by them in their course. This is a first attempt in power systems optimization for me.

### The report for this project is in this repository as MEGN688-final-project.pdf. That document will include a summary of my code results, imagery, and basics about the unit commitment model.
