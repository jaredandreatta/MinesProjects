### This is my final project for my MEGN688 (Advanced Integer Optimization) course at School of Mines. The project uses the classic unit commitment model to solve 1-7 days worth of unit commitment cases. This model is basd off the [Power Systems Optimization Course]https://github.com/Power-Systems-Optimization-Course/power-systems-optimization
