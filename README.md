# Welcome to my coursework repository. 
### This is a collection of projects I've completed during my graduate school tenure at the Colorado School of Mines. I am earning a double MS in Energy Economics and Applied Mathematics/Statistics. I am also doing a graduate certificate in data science. My work is very interdisciplinary by nature, so the works included here span several topics. Here are the course codes for courses I have taken or am currently taking:

### - DSCI403 - Advanced Data Science (Python)
### - MEGN688 - Advanced Integer Optimization (Julia)
### - EBGN590 - Econometrics (Python and R)
### - EENG521 - Numerical Optimization (Python)
### - MATH531 - Linear Model Theory (Python and R)
