# Welcome to my coursework repository. 
### This is a collection of projects I've completed during my graduate school tenure at the Colorado School of Mines. I am earning a double MS in Energy Economics and Applied Mathematics/Statistics. I am also doing a graduate certificate in data science. My work is very interdisciplinary by nature, so the works included here span several topics. Here are the course codes for courses I have taken or am currently taking:

### - DSCI403 - Advanced Data Science (Python)
### - MEGN688 - Advanced Integer Optimization (Julia)
### - EBGN590 - Econometrics (Python and R)
### - EBGN594 - Time Series Econometrics (Python, R, and possibly some Julia)
### - MATH408 - Computational Differential Equations (MATLAB)

### If anyone reads through any of these and has any questions, comments, or feedback, I'd be happy to hear. Thank you!
