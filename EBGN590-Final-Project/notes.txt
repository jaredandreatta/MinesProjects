The goal of this analysis is to examine the magnitude of impact that changes in producer costs in the non-renewable energy extraction and refining sectors have on end-use consumer energy costs. I will use the special energy index as a measurement of consumer costs, and ppis of non-renewable extractors/refiners used to measure producer costs. I will use economic control variables and renewable consumption controls in the model as well.

Null hypothesis-PPI price increases will have no significant effect on end-use consumer energy costsd
